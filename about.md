    <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to provide accurate information to newcomers—people who might be new to A.A.—about Alcoholics Anonymous. It's meant to guide someone to the right spot for A.A.'s approved material, and its simplicity is intentional. While there are many valuable resources available for someone interested in the A.A. program, this is not an attempt to replace any of those. This is an attempt to make it easier for the still suffering alcoholic to find the information they need to begin their journey.</p>
